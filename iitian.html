                            IITIANGUIDE unlike any other online coaching platform is on a mission to build strong mental and emotional foundations for the students to help them confront any problem in life. We not only provide the best IITian Experts for tutoring students, but we also train our mentors to deliver guidance on things that surprisingly matter far more than academics and are responsible for a large part of the success one achieves. These include topics like goal manifestation, habit formation, time management, memorizing techniques, secrets to enhance focus and concentration, nurturing an optimistic mindset and a lot more. These things play an imperative role in a student’s life and academic success which most of the students are unaware of since these things aren’t a part of the education system. These are the secrets that toppers use the most and which separate them from the rest.

                            Apart from the stuff mentioned, our mentors also provide students with revision strategies, smart study tips and tricks, time-table and scheduling routines, note-making insights and other useful tips and strategies related to cracking the exam 
                            and fairing out better everytime.</p>

                            IITIANGUIDE believes that doubt removal is an integral part of any entrance exam preparation which should be handled exquisitely. No doubt should go unanswered, which is why IITIANGUIDE has a continual doubt removal procedure that includes frequent doubt removal sessions and online discussion forums that are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Unlike the traditional model, where students must wait until the next scheduled class to clear their doubts, IITIANGUIDE manages an online discussion forum where students can post their doubts at any time and receive a response.    </p>

                            The student enrols by choosing the number of one-on-one sessions he or she requires. The time spent conducting the session is deducted from the total hours. The length of time depends entirely on the learner and the subject he or she wishes to learn. A session will last about 1.5 hours on average.

The student can also opt for pre-made topic-wise economical packages on the website for one-on-one consultancy from an IITian expert. These are best when the student wishes to study a particular chapter/topic in the syllabus entirely from the instructor. Selected premium numerical problems will also be provided in these packages which will be sufficient when it comes to revision before any examination. Study material and revision notes will also be provided for the topic opted for.  </p>

                            The batch sizes are small (no more than 20-30), allowing the teacher to get to know each student individually.

This allows the students to communicate more effectively with the teacher and open up about their concerns. This creates a welcoming environment, which leads to a clear and focussed mind. They are also more competitive towards their
 goals because they are a part of a small, focused group.       </p>

The student's entire development is aided by the simple interaction with an IITian mentor. The student is free to customize their own study plan and timings and ask doubts without having to worry about peer pressure (as in case of group JEE Coaching). The pace of instruction and preparation can be adjusted based on
